/// The [parent-join](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/parent-join.html)
/// and [nested](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html)
/// features allow the return of documents that have matches in a different scope. In the
/// parent/child case, parent documents are returned based on matches in child documents or
/// child documents are returned based on matches in parent documents. In the nested case,
/// documents are returned based on matches in nested inner objects.
///
/// In both cases, the actual matches in the different scopes that caused a document to be
/// returned are hidden. In many cases, itâ€™s very useful to know which inner nested objects
/// (in the case of nested) or children/parent documents (in the case of parent/child) caused
/// certain information to be returned. The inner hits feature can be used for this. This
/// feature returns per search hit in the search response additional nested hits that caused a
/// search hit to match in a different scope.
///
/// Inner hits can be used by defining an `inner_hits` definition on a `nested`, `has_child`
/// or `has_parent` query and filter.
