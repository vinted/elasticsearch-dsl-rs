/// aggregated documents. These values can be generated from specific numeric or [histogram fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/histogram.html)
/// in the documents.
///
/// The `boxplot` aggregation returns essential information for making a [box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot):
/// minimum, maximum median, first quartile (25th percentile) and third quartile (75th percentile) values.
///
/// The algorithm used by the `boxplot` metric is called TDigest (introduced by Ted Dunning in
/// [Computing Accurate Quantiles using T-Digests](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf)).
///
/// > Boxplot as other percentile aggregations are also [non-deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm).
/// > This means you can get slightly different results using the same data.
