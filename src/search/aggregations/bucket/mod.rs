//! Bucket aggregations donâ€™t calculate metrics over fields like the metrics aggregations do,
//! but instead, they create buckets of documents. Each bucket is associated with a criterion
//! (depending on the aggregation type) which determines whether or not a document in the current
//! context "falls" into it. In other words, the buckets effectively define document sets.
//! In addition to the buckets themselves, the `bucket` aggregations also compute
//! and return the number of documents that "fell into" each bucket.
//!
//! Bucket aggregations, as opposed to `metrics` aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations.
//! These sub-aggregations will be aggregated for the buckets created by their "parent" bucket aggregation.
//!
//! There are different bucket aggregators, each with a different "bucketing" strategy.
//! Some define a single bucket, some define fixed number of multiple buckets,
//! and others dynamically create the buckets during the aggregation process.
//!
//! > The maximum number of buckets allowed in a single response is limited by
//! > a dynamic cluster setting named
//! > [`search.max_buckets`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-settings.html#search-settings-max-buckets).
//! > It defaults to `65,535`. Requests that try to return more than the limit will fail with an exception.
