//! An aggregation summarizes your data as metrics, statistics, or other analytics.
//!
//! Aggregations help you answer questions like:
//!
//! 1. Whatâ€™s the average load time for my website?
//! 2. Who are my most valuable customers based on transaction volume?
//! 3. What would be considered a large file on my network?
//! 4. How many products are in each product category?
//!
//! Elasticsearch organizes aggregations into three categories:
//!
//! - [Metrics](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics.html) aggregations that calculate metrics, such as a sum or average, from field values.
//! - [Bucket](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket.html) aggregations that group documents into buckets, also called bins, based on field values, ranges, or other criteria.
//! - [Pipeline](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-pipeline.html) aggregations that take input from other aggregations instead of documents or fields.
